        "As a developer, I had the pleasure of working in a team of four to create a single-page application (SPA) during a 48-hour hackathon. Our goal was to develop a website that introduces users to the concept of unlearning, promoting a more sustainable and inclusive world. Starting from scratch, we followed a detailed Figma design provided by the client, which called for a minimalistic and user-friendly interface that would make the information easily accessible and engaging. Given the tight deadline, we prioritized implementing essential features that would enhance the user experience, focusing on simplicity and functionality. Working remotely, we relied on Git and GitHub to communicate efficiently and manage our codebase, which allowed us to stay organized and collaborate seamlessly despite the high-pressure environment. This project not only strengthened my technical skills with React but also taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork in delivering a cohesive product within strict time constraints.
