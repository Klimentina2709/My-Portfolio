                Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer and Web Designer who loves creating
                websites that look great and work smoothly. My journey began in
                the world of art, where I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in
                Classical Painting. This experience helped me develop a strong
                appreciation for design and composition, which I now bring into
                the digital world.

              <Text fontSize={{ base: "md", md: "lg", lg: "xl" }}>
                Then, I continued my education at{" "}
                <strong>Brainster - Front End Academy</strong>. At Brainster, I
                embarked on my Front-End Development journey, learning many
                important skills, including JavaScript, React.js, Next.js,
                TypeScript, and Git. This time was a turning point for me, as I
                gained the technical skills needed to build modern websites.

              <Text fontSize={{ base: "md", md: "lg", lg: "xl" }}>
                Throughout my time at Brainster, I not only mastered the
                fundamentals of web development but also explored advanced
                topics such as responsive design and performance optimization.
                Collaborating on hands-on projects allowed me to apply my skills
                in real-world scenarios, developing a strong understanding of
                modern web practices. I became proficient in using tools like
                Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS for styling, as well as Material-UI
                for building robust, accessible components, and much more.

                My journey at Brainster was not just about learning; it was also
                about community. Engaging with fellow students and mentors
                fostered a collaborative environment where we shared ideas and
                provided feedback on each otherâ€™s projects, enhancing our
                learning experience. I left the program not only with a solid
                technical foundation but also with a network of talented
                individuals who inspire and motivate me.
